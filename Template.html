			Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. In su,,er season,  the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season completes.  The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.<br><br><br>
			Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. People generally take advantage of the high temperatures by spending more time outdoors during summer. Activities such as travelling to the beach and picnics occur during the summer months. Sports such as soccer, basketball, football, volleyball, skateboarding, baseball, softball, cricket, tennis and golf are played. Water sports also occur. These include water skiing, wakeboarding, swimming, surfing, tubing and water polo.<br>
