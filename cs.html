			<br><br>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At springtime, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season completes.
